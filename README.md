# Mission to Mars

# Overview of the project 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to work with Robin to develop code to automatically scrape the latest Mars news and images.  She wants to use the latest and greatest data to keep her Mars application up-to-date and fresh so her users can share in her eagerness about all things Mars!  She would also like to work for NASA one day.  She's hoping she can capture the attention of NASA and open doors that could land her a role within the organization.


# Results

## Latest Mars news

The code we developed first gets the latest Mars news headline and teaser from redplanetscience.com.  These articles help keep the app’s users informed about the latest discoveries and investigations into the red planet.

The screenshot below shows a recent headline scraped from the site for use on Robin’s application.

## Mars featured image

The code then obtains the featured image from spaceimages-mars.com.  This site features high quality images of Mars in conjunction with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology.  

Showing Robin’s users exciting and interesting featured images helps keeps the application engaging and piques her user’s curiosity.

The image above, one of the featured images, show a dusty space cloud.

## Mars Facts

Next, the code gathers a table that compares various facts for Mars and Earth from galaxyfacts-mars.com.  This table helps the apps users understand how the red planet compares to our own.

The table above will update with additional findings as they are added to the original site.

## Mars Hemisphere Images

Finally, the code visits marshemispheres.com.  Here the code retrieves high quality images and titles of the images for the Cerberus, Schiaparelli, Syrtis Major, and Valles Marineris hemispheres.

These images, below, help to keep Robin’s application visually interesting and engaging.

## Visual Enhancements

A number of visual Bootstrap enhancements were added to the website to make it more appealing.  

The text for the various headings were centered to provide a more consistent, streamlined look.  Each of the main sections, and the scraping button, was also converted to a red color to help subtly continue the theme of the red planet.  The corners were rounded for the hemisphere images and the sizing was reduced to allow these images, for many screen widths, to display two across.  As needed for smaller form factors such as mobile phones, the images will automatically adjust for the best representation possible.

# Summary

Working with Robin to develop scripting to automate the webscraping process allows Robin to easily, efficiently, and with very little effort, look for updated data and keep her users abreast of the latest news and images for Mars.

It was a pleasure to be part of the team that can bring continual insights and knowledge to Robin’s users and help make her application a prime source of news about Mars.

Bringing it all together, below is a screenshot of what the app with its current components could look like.  As the application matures, additional content and features could be added to meet her users desires.
